<h1>Writing a codec for <code>libavcodec</code></h1>

<h3><em>Anamitra Ghorui</em></h3>

<h3><em>Last updated 24 August 2020</em></h3>

<hr />

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>This document is more or less a run down of my experience with making a codec
for <a href="https://ffmpeg.org" title="FFMpeg Website">FFMpeg</a> with the intent of letting future developers have a
slightly easier time of figuring out where things are.</p>

<p>During my time with FFMpeg, I have only worked with developing a video codec
up till now. Hence, my knowlegde is more or less limited to libavcodec,
libavformat, and libavutil.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, please shoot me an email at aghorui (at) teknik
(dot) io or open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/daujerrine/ffmpeg-doc">github</a>.</p>

<p>This document is under public domain.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The FFMpeg suite is a program largely written in C. It's code base is extremely
large consisting of countless codecs, filters, formats, display/audio
facilities, etc.</p>

<p>There are 3 sub-libraries that one is mostly concerned with while writing a
codec:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>libavcodec</code>, the Encoder/Decoder library,</li>
<li><code>libavformat</code>, the file format and audio/video demuxer library, and</li>
<li><code>libavutil</code>, utility library used by other libraries in the FFMpeg suite.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other libraries that are of lesser concern are:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>libavfilter</code>, the audio/video data transformation (filtering) library. A
filter (scale) is needed if you want to convert between pixel formats
(discussed later)).</li>
<li><code>libswscale</code>, included by the scale filter. Includes pixel format conversion
routines.</li>
</ol>

<p>Developing for FFmpeg, or any other library for that matter, requires one to go
through and read a large amount of source code in order to actually introduce
a component or change in it, maybe moreso in FFMpeg. This document will outline
some of the functions that one shall go through, and explain some things that
are not directly mentioned within inline comments or documentation.</p>

<h2>The Encoding/Decoding (Transcoding) Process</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#toc-Detailed-description" title="FFMpeg CLI Documentation">man page</a> of the FFMpeg CLI interface provides a good
introduction to how ffmpeg works.</p>

<p>The FFmpeg CLI performs the following operations in the whole transcoding
process.</p>

<p><code>
ffmpeg -i in_file out_file
</code></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>libavformat: Probing:</strong> The input file is <em>probed</em> to determine the file
format.</li>
<li><strong>libavformat: Read Header:</strong> The header is read to get values like duration,
pixel format, metadata, number of frames, aspect ratio, bitrate etc.</li>
<li><strong>libavformat: Read Packet:</strong> </li>
</ol>

<h2>Timestamps</h2>

<p>Timestamps are simply a numerical quantity that represents time. Used in the
following contexts:
1. <code>pts</code> <strong>- Presentation Timestamp:</strong> Time at which a frame is presented to the
   user.
2. <code>dts</code> <strong>- Decode Timestamp:</strong> Time at which </p>

<h2>Distinction between formats and encoded audio/video data</h2>

  <h3>Note for Developers with a Background in Object Oriented Languages</h3>

<p>C does not have classes and similar provisions in the language, however, a
very similar method of programming is observable over here in the form of
<em>context</em> structs and functions. Storage structs are used to handle repetitive
patterns such as for a set of decoder functions, parameters etc.</p>
